Version 0.4.0

New functionality:

 - Added support for Android L Preview and Android Lollipop.
 - Added a custom-built version of 'zipalign' to support APK archives above 2GB.
 - Added a custom-built version of 'ndk-depends' to manually supply up-to-date listings of internal device libraries.

Fixes/Improvements:

 - (MSBuild) Improved identification of exported scripts; version descriptors are now copied alongside each platform.
 - (MSBuild) Fixed an issue causing Java compilation to occur only on BuildConfig.java and R.java files, despite lack of project .java sources.

Upgrade notes:

 - An r10 derivative release of the Android NDK is required in order to target 64-bit architectures.

 - (Debugger) Bumped attach time-out to 60 seconds to support older, slower devices.
 - (Debugger) Improved protection against spaces in file-names in several additional places.
 - (Debugger) Improved performance and consistency of contiguous GDB/MI output, ensuring responses are handed in-order.
 - (Debugger) Fixed behaviour when GDB connections are lost or dropped. This should also include pulling the USB cable.
 - (Debugger) Added ability to process concurrent GDB/MI stream output whilst handling an 'async' event.
 - (MSBuild) Silenced the FC command which gave confusing stderr output when files weren't present.
 - (MSBuild) Modified 'AdditionalDependencies' to make its behaviour more consistent with Win32. Removed 'AdditionalLibraries' as a result.

 - (Debugger) Added a new connection pending UI dialog, and fixed majority of launch/connection stalls within Visual Studio.

Fixes/Improvements:

 - (Debugger) Corrected problems when attempting to pull application libraries off a device, especially after Jelly Bean 4.2.
 - (Debugger) Major reworking of DebugLauncher components to support connection UI and asynchronous installations to device.
 - (Debugger) Ensured that the user is informed about devices that are affected by the run-as permissions bug.
